# Pikachu

A programming language of the most cute pokemon based on Brainfuck.

## Introduction

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and is notable for its extreme minimalism.

For more information on it or some tutorials, please go to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

Here, I assume that you've mastered Brainfuck.

The pikachu programming language is just a simple variation of it:
- `pi` replaces `<`
- `ka` replaces `+`
- `chu` replaces `>`

So, as the Brainfuck language, in theory, you can write any program with it:)

But for the implementation, the "memory" is limited by 300000.

Just4fun, it's enough!

## Use

Make sure you have `flex`+`bison`/`lex`+`yacc` installed.

1. Generate token parser code with lex:

```bash
lex pikachu.l
```

You'll get `lex.yy.c`.

2. Generate grammar parser code with yacc:

```bash
yacc -d pikachu.y
```

You'll get `y.tab.c` and `y.tab.h`.

3. Compile:

```bash
gcc y.tab.c lex.yy.c -ly -o pikachu
```

4. Test:

```bash
./pikachu < test-helloworld.txt
```

You should get the output `Hello World!`.

## Code

Code your program on Brainfuck, transform `<` with `pi`, `>` with `chu`, `+` with `ka`, and keep the other characters not changed.

Then you master the programming language `pikachu`.
